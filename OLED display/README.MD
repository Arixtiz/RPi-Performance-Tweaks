Welcome to PiMastery, your guide to OLED displays and harnessing system information on Raspberry Pi. Explore overclocking, stats visualization, and powerful scripts. Join our community for Pi adventures!

## Installing Dependencies

If pip can't install dependencies automatically, manually add them:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-pil libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libopenjp2-7 libtiff5 -y

```

For non-Raspberry Pi OS, consult your Linux distro's docs for the correct procedure.

Tip: If your distro has Pillow, use it instead of pip. Example:


```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3-imaging
# or
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pil
```

## Permissions

luma.oled needs hardware access permission. After installation, add the user to required groups:

```bash
$ sudo usermod -a -G spi,gpio,i2c pi
```
Replace pi with your account name.

# Pin Connection for OLED Display on Raspberry Pi ðŸ“Œ

Ensure to connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to the Display according to the following table:

| Pin | Name | Meaning   | Raspberry Pi Pin | Raspberry Pi Function |
| --- | ---- | --------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1   | GND  | Ground    | P01-6             | GND                    |
| 2   | VCC  | +3.3V Power| P01-1             | 3V3                    |
| 3   | SCL  | Clock     | P01-5             | GPIO 3 (SCL)           |
| 4   | SDA  | Data      | P01-3             | GPIO 2 (SDA)           |

Ensure to follow these connections to ensure proper operation of the OLED display with your Raspberry Pi.
