# OLED Display and System Information for Raspberry Pi ðŸš€ðŸ“Š

Welcome to PiMastery, your guide to OLED displays and harnessing system information on Raspberry Pi. Explore overclocking, stats visualization, and powerful scripts. Join our community for Pi adventures!

## Installing Dependencies

If pip can't install dependencies automatically, manually add them:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-pil libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libopenjp2-7 libtiff5 -y

```

For non-Raspberry Pi OS, consult your Linux distro's docs for the correct procedure.

Tip: If your distro has Pillow, use it instead of pip. Example:


```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3-imaging
# or
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pil
```

## Permissions

luma.oled needs hardware access permission. After installation, add the user to required groups:

```bash
$ sudo usermod -a -G spi,gpio,i2c pi
```
Replace pi with your account name.

# Pin Connection for OLED Display on Raspberry Pi ðŸ“Œ

Ensure to connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to the Display according to the following table:

| Pin | Name | Meaning   | Raspberry Pi Pin | Raspberry Pi Function |
| --- | ---- | --------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1   | GND  | Ground    | P01-6             | GND                    |
| 2   | VCC  | +3.3V Power| P01-1             | 3V3                    |
| 3   | SCL  | Clock     | P01-5             | GPIO 3 (SCL)           |
| 4   | SDA  | Data      | P01-3             | GPIO 2 (SDA)           |

Ensure to follow these connections to ensure proper operation of the OLED display with your Raspberry Pi.

# Run on Init - Automatic Execution on Raspberry Pi Startup

## Overview

Automate the execution of a Python script on Raspberry Pi startup using cron. This simple guide will help you set up a cron job to run your script every time the Pi boots up.

## Steps

1. Open the crontab configuration:
```bash
$ crontab -e
```
Add the following line to the crontab file:
```bash
@reboot python3 /home/pi/sys_info.py &
```
This line ensures that the Python script (sys_info.py in this case) will be executed in the background every time the Raspberry Pi reboots.

Save the changes and exit the editor.

For Nano, press Ctrl + X, then Y, and finally Enter.

For Vim, type :wq and press Enter.

The script will now run automatically on Raspberry Pi startup.

Note
Ensure the script's path and name are correct, and the Python interpreter is installed. Adjust the path and script name in the cron command accordingly.
